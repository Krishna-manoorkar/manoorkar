## Introduction
I am a PhD student at Vrije University, Amsterdam, the Netherlands as the School of Business and Economics under supervision of Prof. Alessandra Palmigiano and Prof. Nachoem Wijnberg.

My research focuses on logic and its applications to theoretical computer science. My research interests include logics for computer science, reasoning under uncertainty, knowledge representation and reasoning, non-classical logics, modal logics, dynamic logics. On the theoretical side, I have worked on correspondence theory, and algebraic proof theory for different logics, while on more practical side I have worked on applications of these logics to computer science and social sciences.
