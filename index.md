title: Krishna Manoorkar

I am a PhD student at Vrije University, Amsterdam, the Netherlands as the School of Business and Economics under supervision of Prof. Alessandra Palmigiano and Prof. Nachoem Wijnberg. My research focuses on logic and its applications to theoretical computer science. 

My research interests include logics for computer science, reasoning under uncertainty, knowledge representation and reasoning,  non-classical logics, modal logics, dynamic logics.  On the theoretical side, I have worked on correspondence theory, and  algebraic proof theory for different  logics, while on more practical side I have worked on applications of these logics to computer science and social sciences. 

My research has largely focused on developing a formal framework for  categorization and logics for reasoning about categories and decision-making with applications to  computer science. With my co-authors  have used  this framework to formalize reasoning about approximate/fuzzy categories or categorization with incomplete or uncertain information, description logics for knowledge about categorzation, categorizations parametrized by epistemic attitudes of agents, defeasible rerasoning about categories and explored its application to categorization algorithms.
