**Formal model for categorization and reasoning about categories**
**
I have been working with my co-authors on developing a formal framework for categorization and logics for reasoning about categories and decision-making with applications to computer science. With my co-authors have used this framework to formalize reasoning about approximate/fuzzy categories or categorization with incomplete or uncertain information, description logics for knowledge about categorzation, categorizations parametrized by epistemic attitudes of agents, defeasible rerasoning about categories and explored its application to categorization algorithms.
