## Formal framework for modelling and reasoning about categorization

My research has largely focused on developing a formal 
framework for categorization and logics for reasoning about categories and decision-making with applications to computer science. With my co-authors have used this framework to formalize reasoning about approximate/fuzzy categories or categorization with incomplete or uncertain information, description logics for knowledge about categorzation, categorizations parametrized by epistemic attitudes of agents, defeasible rerasoning about categories and explored its application to categorization algorithms.
